Introduction 

In this case study, we delve into the world of sales data to uncover valuable insights and trends. By leveraging SQL queries, we will navigate through the dataset, performing data exploration, filtering, and aggregation operations.Throughout the repository, you will find SQL scripts, queries, and accompanying documentation that guide you step-by-step through the analysis process. 

We have included an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. illustrating the relationships between key entities such as customers, orders, order items, products. The ER diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure and helps in understanding the underlying data model for the sales analysis case study.
